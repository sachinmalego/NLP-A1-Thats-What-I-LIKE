# NLP-A1-That's-What-I-LIKE

This repository contains the implementation of a web application for exploring Word2Vec and GloVe models in natural language processing.

## Overview
This application provides a user-friendly interface to interact with Word2Vec and GloVe embeddings. Users can explore vector representations of words, visualize similarity relationships, and gain insights into these foundational NLP techniques.

## Features
- Interactive exploration of Word2Vec and GloVe embeddings.
- Word similarity visualization.
- Simple and intuitive web interface.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)
- VSCode or any preferred code editor

### Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the `app` folder:
   ```bash
   cd app
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages.

### Deployment
1. Open the `app` folder in VSCode or your preferred editor.
2. Open the terminal in your editor or use your system terminal.
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python3 app.py
   ```
4. Note the local deployment address printed in the terminal, typically `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

### Testing the Application
1. Open your browser.
2. Enter the local deployment server address (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`).
3. Interact with the web application to explore Word2Vec and GloVe functionalities.

## Usage
The web application allows you to:
- Visualize word embeddings.
- Analyze word similarities and relationships.
- Compare the performance of Word2Vec and GloVe models.

## Files and Directories
- `app/`: Contains the web application code and necessary files.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies required for the project.
